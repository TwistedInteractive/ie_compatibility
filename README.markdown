# IE Compatibility for Symphony CMS

This extension aims to make Symphony as compatible as possible with Internet Explorer 7 & 8.

It is based on the [HTML5Shiv extension](https://github.com/passbe/HTML5Shiv) created by [Ben Passmore](https://github.com/passbe)

This extension:

 * inserts the HTML5Shiv JavaScript library available from [http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/](http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) into every administration page. This is to aide in backwards compatibility with HTML5 elements in IE8 or below.
 * adds additional stylesheets for IE7 and IE8
